Repository for creating unreal engine plugins. Specifically, the goal of this repository is to:

- Try implementing full polished versions of certain supporting game features that I haven't had the chance to try, or make polished versions of, like tutorial or telemetry systems.
- Make these systems modular, and easily portable to other unreal projects from UE 5.3 and up, to enable those projects to use these features from the beginning of development.
- Get practice making plugins, and with using plugin-related paradigms like further use of modules.
